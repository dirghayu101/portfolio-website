## RAID in Production

RAID 5 is the configuration most commonly used in production environments. However, it comes with limitations you should be aware of.  

RAID 5 is not well-suited for **transactional databases** because it performs poorly with write-heavy workloads. The reason is simple: RAID 5 is optimized for reads, not writes.  

If you are dealing with frequent transactions, **RAID 10** is recommended. It provides better performance for writes, though it is significantly more expensive due to disk requirements.

## Factors for Capacity Planning

When planning for capacity, it's important to focus on workload rather than just storage volume. Here are the critical factors to consider:

### Drive Space
Do you need **Direct Access Storage**? Think about whether your application might rely on single drives while supporting thousands of concurrent users.  

### Disk Controller Limitations
The controller can become a bottleneck if it isn't able to handle the volume of reads and writes required by your workload.  

### Planning for Workload, Not Volume
Always plan for **the type of work being done**—not just how much storage you have. A system with terabytes of space is useless if it can't handle the IOPS needed for your application.

## Assessing Workload

So, how do you actually measure and assess workload for proper planning?

- Use **Windows Performance Monitor** to check the number of database disk reads and writes generated by an application.  
- Check the **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** of the individual disk. This value is provided by the hardware manufacturer. A good baseline to keep in mind is **125 IO per disk**.

## Calculating Disks and Controllers for Maximum Throughput

To achieve maximum throughput, you'll need to determine both the number of disks and controllers required.  

You'll also need a **RAID adjuster** in your calculations. For example, RAID 10 writes data twice, so the RAID adjuster value will be 2.  

**Formula:**  

```

Required Disks = (Reads/sec + (Writes/sec × RAID Adjuster)) ÷ Disk IOPS

```

Using 125 as the IOPS value is a good rule of thumb unless specified otherwise by the manufacturer.

## Protocols Used in Databases

Different protocols are used to connect and communicate with databases. Common ones include:

- **Named Pipes**  
- **Shared Memory**: Mostly used for debugging purposes.  
- **TCP/IP**: The most widely used for network-based communication.

## Oracle: Database vs User vs Schema

In Oracle, the concepts of **database**, **user**, and **schema** often confuse beginners. Here's a simple breakdown:

- In Oracle, **users and schemas are essentially the same thing**.  
- A **user** is the account you use to connect to the database. A **schema** is the set of objects (tables, views, etc.) that belong to that account.  
- When you create a user with the `CREATE USER` statement, you also create the corresponding schema (initially empty).  
- An administrator can then grant privileges to that user, allowing it to create tables, run queries, insert data, and more.  
- The **database** itself contains all the users, their data, and predefined system objects (tables, views, system users) that make Oracle function.

## Final Thoughts

Capacity planning isn't about just buying bigger disks—it's about understanding workload patterns, RAID trade-offs, and controller limitations. By measuring IOPS, calculating disk requirements properly, and knowing how your database handles connections and schemas, you can build a setup that is both reliable and performant.
