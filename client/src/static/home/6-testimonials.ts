His expertise in backend development, particularly with Node.js and PostgreSQL made him the go-to person for any backend issues we faced during our project. He handled some of the trickiest parts of the backend of our website exceptionally. He is very good at explaining technical details to others. I highly recommend Joshi for any role that requires strong technical and problem solving skills.",
