When a new company starts deploying from scratch, it's often advantageous to begin with **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**. This allows developers to focus on building applications rather than worrying about servers or infrastructure.  

On the other hand, when comparing major cloud providers:  
- **Azure** is often considered stronger in **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**.  
- **AWS** is often considered stronger in **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**.  

Applications that customers directly use fall under **Software as a Service (SaaS)**—think Gmail, Office 365, or Discord.

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

In the **IaaS model**, you request the hardware resources you need, and they are provisioned and managed for you.  

For example:  
If you ask for a virtual machine with **4 vCPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and 250 GB SSD storage**, you'll get exactly that. From there, it's your responsibility to install, configure, and maintain everything from the operating system upward.

### Key Characteristics
- Provides **hardware resources** such as servers, CPUs, memory, storage, and networking.  
- Full control is given to the customer to install their own OS, middleware, and applications.  
- From a company's perspective, it feels almost like migrating to a new physical server.  

### Typical Use Cases
- **Enterprises with existing on-premises infrastructure** often start with IaaS when moving to the cloud. It allows them to replicate their setup with minimal changes.  
- **Development and testing environments** also benefit from IaaS. For example, developers can quickly spin up virtual machines to test apps on environments similar to what clients might use.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

With **PaaS**, developers don't worry about the infrastructure. They simply write code, upload it, and let the platform handle the rest.  

You're responsible for your **application code and data**, but everything else—operating system, middleware, runtime, and scaling—is handled by the provider.

### Key Features
- Supports multiple runtimes, from **web servers** and **SQL databases** to **container platforms** like Docker.  
- Providers offer dozens of available environments: Python, C#, Node.js, Java, and more.  
- Includes **operating systems, middleware (like VS Code, SQL Server, Firefox), and runtime environments**.  

### Why PaaS?
This is especially advantageous for **startups** and teams building cloud-native apps from scratch. Instead of spending time configuring infrastructure, developers can focus on coding and delivering value faster.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

**SaaS** is the model most people are already familiar with. The application is fully built and hosted by the provider. As a user, you simply log in and start using it.  

### Examples
- **Office 365** for productivity tools  
- **Gmail** for email  
- **Discord** for communication  

From a company's perspective, SaaS is purchased as a subscription or contract. For example, for corporate email, a business might pay Microsoft for Office 365. All the setup, storage, and maintenance is Microsoft's responsibility—the company only needs to provide account details.

### Benefits
- No infrastructure management.  
- Quick onboarding and scalability.  
- Predictable subscription-based pricing.

# Wrapping Up

Understanding **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS** is critical for making the right cloud strategy decisions:  

- **IaaS** offers maximum control, ideal for enterprises migrating from on-premises.  
- **PaaS** accelerates development by abstracting infrastructure, making it perfect for startups.  
- **SaaS** delivers ready-to-use software with minimal setup, great for end users and businesses alike.  

Each has its place, and most organizations use a mix depending on their goals.
